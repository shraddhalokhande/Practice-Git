Step1:

Let use this file for Squashing the commits.

Don’t push your work until you’re happy with it :
One of the cardinal rules of Git is that, since so much work is local within your clone,
you have a great deal of freedom to rewrite your history locally. However, once you push
your work, it is a different story entirely, and you should consider pushed work as final
unless you have good reason to change it. In short, you should avoid pushing your work until
you’re happy with it and ready to share it with the rest of the world.

Step 2
Squash commit step 2
lets rewrite the history :)
